# Finding informative regions in grayscale mammogram images.

### Project Description
The objective of this term paper is to explore methods for finding informative regions in grayscale mammogram images. The focus will be on developing an approach to identify regions in mammogram images that contain relevant information for breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Keypoint detection algorithms will be employed for finding informative regions in grayscale mammogram images by identifying and localizing significant structures or features that contain relevant information for breast cancer detection.

Keypoint detection algorithms, such as ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), can be applied to identify distinctive points or regions in the mammogram images.

ORB performs as well as SIFT on the task of feature detection (and is better than SURF) while being almost two orders of magnitude faster. ORB builds on the well-known FAST keypoint detector and the BRIEF descriptor. Both of these techniques are attractive because of their good performance and low cost.
